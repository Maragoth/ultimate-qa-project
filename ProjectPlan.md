# üóÇÔ∏è Project Plan ‚Äì Ultimate QA Project

## üéØ Project Goal & Scope

The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive QA Automation framework that simulates a real-world enterprise-level testing environment.

It includes fully automated testing across Web UI, API, Mobile, and hybrid layers, integrated with CI/CD pipelines and a locally hosted backend stack.

**Scope includes:**
- Full CRUD API testing with schema validation and response time checks
- End-to-end UI testing with Playwright and Page Object Model across multiple browsers
- Mobile UI testing using Appium on a physical Android device (mobile browser)
- Hybrid tests combining API-based data setup with UI validation
- Continuous integration with GitHub Actions and matrix builds (Node.js, Python, browsers)
- Local environment with PostgreSQL database deployed in a Docker container
- Centralized QA orchestration using n8n to automate environment setup, test execution, and report aggregation



## üõ°Ô∏è Test Strategy

### API Testing (Python + Pytest + JSON Schema)
- Authentication & Token handling (valid, expired, missing, malformed tokens)
- CRUD operations for Users, Articles, Comments
- Negative test scenarios (4xx, 5xx responses, malformed JSON, unsupported methods)
- Input validation: boundary values, special characters (e.g. emoji, ≈Ç, √ß)
- Dependency rules (e.g. deleting article deletes related comments)
- Partial updates (e.g. PATCH-style PUT /user with subset of fields)
- JSON Schema validation of API responses
- Response time assertions (<1000ms)
- Stability checks: schema drift, data consistency


### UI Testing (Playwright)
- Full end-to-end user flows: login, registration, article creation, editing, deletion
- Interaction testing: favoriting, following authors, commenting, tag-based filtering
- Dynamic data verification: updated profiles, images, and navigation based on login state
- Visual and behavioral validation across multiple browsers using Playwright projects
- Page Object Model used for maintainable and scalable test architecture
- Covers both positive scenarios and negative cases (e.g. invalid credentials, missing input)

### Hybrid Testing (UI + API)
- Combines API requests for data setup with UI tests for visual and functional validation
- Enables fast and stable test execution by bypassing repetitive UI steps (e.g., registration, login)
- Uses API to create test data (users, articles, comments) and verifies expected behavior through the UI
- Helps isolate frontend vs backend failures by decoupling test flow between layers

### Mobile Testing (Appium + Physical Android Device)
- Launching mobile Chrome browser and navigating to the web application
- Executing login, registration, and article-related flows on mobile viewport
- Testing UI interactions: creating, editing, deleting articles and comments
- Validating layout responsiveness and element visibility on small screens
- Performing smoke tests of critical user paths on real device
- Ensuring touch interactions, scrolling, and navigation behave as expected


### CI/CD Automation (GitHub Actions)
- Automated test execution on push
- Matrix builds (Node versions, Python versions)
- Allure Reports and HTML reporting
- Dockerized PostgreSQL DB (tests run locally)
