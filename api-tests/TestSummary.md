# ✅ Test Summary – API Tests

## ✅ Scope  
Full API test coverage for user auth, article and comment workflows, profiles, favorites, tags, settings, schema validation, and request/response robustness.  
Part of the **Ultimate QA Project** for the [RealWorld Example App](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld), targeting high stability and production-level test automation.

Executed using Pytest with custom request helpers, schema validation, and performance assertions.

## 🔍 Known Bugs

- **None found**  
  All API flows returned expected results with correct status codes and schema-compliant responses.


## 📈 Stability Results

- **All 13 test modules passed 10/10 times** ✅  
- **All requests responded within <1000ms** ⚡  
- **No flaky behavior or race conditions observed**  
- **Tests executed using local RealWorld backend**  
- **Token reuse, error flows, and edge cases validated**  


## 🧰 Tools & Techniques

- **Framework**: Pytest with JSON Schema and custom helpers
- **Language**: Python 3.12
- **Model**: Request abstraction + isolated test modules

- **Helpers**: Reusable POST/GET/PUT/DELETE + schema validator
- **Assertions**: Status, time, body, and strict structure
- **Fixtures**: Auth token, isolated users, dynamic slugs


## 📌 Conclusion

- API is stable, performant, and fully covered for expected and edge-case flows  
- Test modules are modular, readable, and ready for CI integration  
- No API bugs found during full validation  
- API module is complete and **ready for QA sign-off** ✅
